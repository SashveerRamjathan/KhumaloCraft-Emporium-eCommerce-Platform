## üß† What I Learned

- **Cloud Architecture and Deployment**: This project significantly enhanced my understanding of cloud-based application deployment, particularly with Azure. I learned how to leverage Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings like Azure App Service and Azure SQL Database to build and scale a fully operational web application. The deployment experience reinforced the importance of cloud scalability, security, and performance optimization.

- **Advanced Azure Services**: I gained hands-on experience integrating advanced Azure services, such as Azure Functions and Logic Apps, to automate processes like email notifications and background tasks. These features helped me understand serverless computing and event-driven workflows, which are crucial for modern web applications.

- **Database Integration and Management**: Working with Azure SQL Database allowed me to deepen my knowledge of relational database management, including designing a schema for dynamic data storage, managing transactions, and ensuring data consistency across different parts of the application.

- **Frontend Development with ASP.NET Core MVC**: I sharpened my skills in building dynamic web pages using ASP.NET Core MVC and Razor Pages. I learned how to combine backend logic with frontend design using Bootstrap for responsive, user-friendly interfaces.

- **Security and Performance Optimization**: Securing the application by integrating authentication protocols and optimizing performance with Azure services were key learning outcomes. I realized the importance of balancing usability with secure data handling practices in an e-commerce platform.

- **Collaboration and Version Control**: Using Git and GitHub for version control helped me manage project updates, collaborate effectively, and maintain a clean codebase. It also taught me the significance of proper documentation and structured workflows during the development process.
